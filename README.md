MobileSiteOS HelloJS OAuth2 logins test page

This is a test page for our adapted version of the HelloJS client side Javascript SDK for making OAuth2 logins. As of this writing, I'm not sure it will work, given the nature of serving pages via GitHub and SSL. Regardless, it should mimic the setup of an actual working page, give the current file url locations. If (when?) it actually works, you may try it from here: https://opensitemobile.com/hellojs
