MobileSiteOS logins via HelloJS OAuth2 SDK

This is a test page repository for our adapted version of the HelloJS client side Javascript SDK for making OAuth2 logins. Please note, the demo page in not running from this repository or username.  It is running from a "Fork" of this repository and can viewed here: https://opensitemobile2.com/hellojs. The demo page must run under SSL for obvious reasons, so we run it without a custom domain.
